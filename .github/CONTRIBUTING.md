# Contribution Guide

To encourage active collaboration, Smashed Egg encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. 

Pull requests will only be reviewed when marked as "ready for review" (not in the "draft" state) and all tests for new features are passing. 
Pull requests in a stale state, i.e. left in the "draft" state, will be closed after a few days.
