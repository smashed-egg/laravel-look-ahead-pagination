This package allows you to use Look-ahead pagination in your application.

## What is Look-ahead Pagination

Look-ahead Pagination is more lightweight than Laravel's standard pagination. 

It looks similar to the simple and cursor pagination, so the pages aren't shown in the pagination links,
but the queries under the hood are a lot faster, particularly when the table you are paginating is large. 

## Requirements

* PHP 8.0.2+
* Laravel 9.0+

## Installation

To install this package please run:

```
composer require smashed-egg/laravel-look-ahead-pagination
```
